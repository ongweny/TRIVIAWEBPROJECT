                Trivia refers to pieces of information that are of little importance or significance. 
                It often involves facts, details, or anecdotes that are interesting but not essential or relevant to the main topic of discussion. 
                Trivia can encompass a wide range of subjects, from history and science to pop culture and sports. 
                Trivia is commonly used in quizzes, games, and social settings to entertain, challenge, or test people's knowledge. 
                It adds an element of fun and curiosity to conversations and gatherings, offering tidbits of information that can surprise or delight.
